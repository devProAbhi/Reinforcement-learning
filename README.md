# Reinforcement-learning
Here there is a interaction between Agent which performs action and Environment which give Reward to agent
in chess example, pieces are agent and board is a environment

```
Policy, Pie(s,a)
Probability(a=a|s=s)
```
```
Reward, r
r1->r2->r2->r3 ....->rn
```

```
State, s
s1->s2->s2->s3 ....->sn
```
```
Value, V(s)

```
